                ## ECC Overview
                First we provide a mathematical overview of ECC. An elliptic curve in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is given by the set of all points
                that satisfy the Weirestrass equation:

                $$
                E: Y^2 = X^3 + ax + b, \Delta_E = 4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0
                $$

                We will see why the second regularity condition is required soon. Let $P, Q$ be two points from $E$. We define the addition
                of points $P, Q$ as follows: We start by drawing the line L through P and Q. This line L intersects E at three points, namely P, Q, and one other point R. We take
                that point R and reflect it across the x-axis (i.e., we multiply its Y-coordinateby âˆ’1) to get a new point R. 
                The point R is called the "sum of P and Q", and we use the notation $R = P \oplus Q$. This procedure can be seen on the figure below:

                As a special case, when $P = Q$, we more or less repeat the same procedure, only in the first step we construct a tangent line to the curve $E$

                Another special case for addition that requires attention is if $P = (x, y), P' = (x, -y)$. If we were to draw a line through $P$ and $P'$,
                there would be no third point from $E$ that would also belong to the given line. A special point is introduced, $\mathcal{O}$, with the property that 
                it is contained in every vertical line in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and thus $P \oplus P' = \mathcal{O}$. We will use the notation $P' = -P$.

                From the previous figure, it is also easy to veirfy that $P \oplus \mathcal{O} = P'$. For a fixed elliptic curve $E$, let $P(E)$ denote all points in $\mathbb{R}^2$
                that satisfy the given curve. The following properties hold:
                * $\forall P \in P(E), P \oplus \mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O} + P = P$ (identity)
                * $\forall P \in P(E), P \oplus (-P) = \mathcal{O}$ (existence of inverse)

                * $\forall P, Q, R \in P(E), (P \oplus Q) \oplus R = P \oplus (Q \oplus R)$ (associativity)

                Only property that is not so straightforward to prove is associativity, we will not include the proof here - authors of [1] reference papers that
                contain associativity proof. The main point is that $(P(E) \cup \{\mathcal{O}\}, \oplus)$ is an Abelian group. Furthermore, using elementary calculus

                ## Elliptic curves over finite fields
                Of particular interest for cryptography are elliptic curves over field of residues modulo $p$, $\mathbb{F_p}$, for a prime number $p$. 
                Let $E$ be an elliptic curve, we define the following:
                $$
                E(\mathbb{F_p}) = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{F_p}^2 \mid (x, y) \text{ satisfy } E \} \cup \{\mathcal{O}\}
                $$

                For example, consider $E: Y^2 = X^3 + 3X + 8$ and $\mathbb{F_13}$. 
                We can show that $E(\mathbb{F_{13}}) = \{\mathcal{O}, (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 10), (9, 6), (9, 7), (12, 2), (12, 11)\}$, and thus 
                $|E(\mathbb{F_{13}})| = 9$. 
                
                For a fixed elliptic curve $E$ and field of residues module prime $p$, $\mathbb{F_p}$, the following theorem can be shown:

    _, image, __ = st.columns(3)

    st.markdown(r"""
                Even though this is not important for our use case, the previous theorem can be generalized. 
                If $\mathbb{F} = p^n, n \geq 1$ is a finite field, then $E(\mathbb{F})$ will always be an Abelian group! However, we do not have any guarantees
                that $E(\mathbb{F})$ will be cyclic, and the same applies to $E(\mathbb{F_p})$ as well.

                ## Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem - ECDLP
                For a fixed elliptic curve $E$, prime number $p$, $P \in E(\mathbb{F_p})$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have the following:
                $$
                Q = nP = \underbrace{P \oplus \ldots \oplus P}_{n \text{ times}}
                $$

                The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem - ECDLP boils down to finding $n$ for known values of $Q, P, p, E$. 
                There is no known algorithm that solves the ECDLP problem faster than $O(\sqrt{p})$, 
                while for discrete logarithm in $\mathbb{F_p}$ there is the index calculus ([1]) algorithm that can solve it in 
                sub-exponential time $O(p^\epsilon), \epsilon > 0$. Another appealing property of the group $E(\mathbb{F_p})$ is that cryptographic algorithms
                based on this field can achieve a similar security level as algorithms based in $\mathbb{F_p}$, with a fewer number of bits. For instance, 
                using a prime number of 384 bits in $E(\mathbb{F_p})$ gives roughly the same security as using a prime number of 3072 bits in $\mathbb{F_p}$. [1] 

                When computing $nP$ in practice, we do not actually need to perform $n$ additions - it turns out that we only need $O(logn)$ additions. First, let
                $a \in \mathbb{F_p}, k \geq 0, f(k) \equiv a^k (mod p)$. It's clear that the following recurrence holds:
                $$
                f(k) \equiv \begin{cases} & f(\frac{k}{2})^{2}, k \equiv 0 (mod \text{ } 2) \\
                & f([\frac{k}{2}])^{2} a, k \equiv 1 (mod \text{ } 2) \\
                & 1, k = 0
                \end{cases} (mod p)
                $$

                We can derive a similar algorithm for computing $nP$ in $E(\mathbb{F_p})$, **double-and-add** algorithm:

    st.markdown(r"""
    We implemented elliptic curve addition according to previously outlined addition algorithm, as well as the double-and-add algoritm for efficiently computing
    $nP$ in $E(\mathbb{F_p})$.
                
    When it comes to choosing curve $E$, prime $p$ and generator point, this is not so straightforward as for $\mathbb{F_p}$. For $\mathbb{F_p}$ things 
    are relatively easy - we find a large prime number $p$ and compute one generator in $\mathbb{F_p}$. For $E(\mathbb{F_p})$, after choosing the elliptic curve
    and prime number $p$, as we've stated previously we do not have any guarantees that $E(\mathbb{F_p})$ is cyclic, and checking for this condition would be
    very time consuming. Instead, we typically look at a subgroup of $E(\mathbb{F_p})$ generated by some point $G \in E(\mathbb{F_p})$ with a large prime order - 
    this is to ensure that ECDLP remains resistant to Pohlig-Hellman attacks! Typically trusted research institutions publish values for $E, p, G$ as their 
    recommendations. Some popular standards, which you can use for this implementation of ECC are:

                This version of ECDH algorithm might seem redundant, because the shared secret ends up being $(n_A n_B)P$, but in practice the communicating
                parties most commonly end up using only one coordinate of $P, x$. This is a valid point, and the algorithm can be slighly modified so as to achieve
                non-redundancy. It turns out that when Alice computes $Q_A = n_A P$, it is sufficient to send only $Q_{A}.x$ to Bob, and the same goes for Bob,
                for him it suffices to send only $Q_{B}.x$ to Alice. Since $Q_{A} \in E(\mathbb{F_p})$, Bob can simply plug-in the $Q_{A}.x$ into the curve equation
                to obtain $(Q_{A}.y)^2 \equiv (Q_{A}.x)^3 + aQ_{A}.x + B (mod \text{ }p)$ and take the square root of $(Q_{A}.y)^2$ from here. There exists a general 
                algorithm, **Tonelli-Shanks ([2])** for computing square roots modulo prime number $p$. However, if $p \equiv 3 (mod \text{ } 4)$, it's very simple 
                to show that if $a$ has a square root modulo $p$, then $b \equiv a^{\frac{p + 1}{4}} (mod \text{ } p)$ is the square root of $a$ modulo $p$. For all
                previous standards (and most other standards), chosen primes satisfy the property $p \equiv 3 (mod \text{ } 4)$ 
                so we will be using this property in our implementation as well.

                At any rate, Bob will end up computing one of $\pm Q_{A}.y$, and similarly Alice will end up computing one of $\pm Q_{B}.y$. If we recall that 
                for $P = (x, y) \in E(\mathbb{F_p}), -P = (x, -y)$, then Bob ends up with $(Q_{A}.x, \pm Q_{A}.y) = \pm Q_{A}$, and Alice ends up with $\pm Q_{B}$.
                Finally when they use their secret keys, they both obtain $(\pm (n_{A} n_{B}) P)$, and since in both cases the $x$ coordinate of the final point stays the same,
                they can both declare $x$ as the shared secret!

                In previous pseudocode, $x(P)$ stands for the x-coordinate of a point $P \in E(\mathbb{F_p})$, the notation we used for ECDH was $P.x$. Now, let us prove
                that the previous signature generation algorithm is correct, that is if $(s1, s2)$ is a valid signature for document $d$, then we will obtain
                $(v_1G + v_2V).x \equiv s_1 (mod \text{ } q)$:

                $$
                \begin{align*}
                    v_1G + v_2V &= de (d + ss_1)^{-1} (mod \text{ } q) G + s_1e(d + ss_{1})^{-1} (mod \text{ } q) sG \\
                    & = (de(d + ss_1)^{-1}(mod \text{ } q) + ss_1e(d + ss_1)^{-1}(mod \text{ } q))G \\
                    &= (e \underbrace{(d + ss_1)^{-1}(mod \text{ } q)(d + ss_1)}_{1, G \text{ is of order q}})G = eG \\
                    & \text{ Therefore, the signature } (s1, s2) \text{ for document } d \text{ is valid if and only if } (v_1G + v_2V).x \equiv s_1 (mod \text{ } q)

                Unlike ECDH, we cannot avoid redundancy here, for each document we have to keep two numbers $(s1, s2)$ of the same bit length. When it comes
                to compressing documents to $mod \text{ } q$ space, generally a hash function is used. Since all of our ECC standards use generator points of 
                256-bit prime order, we will use **SHA-256** hash function.

    ## Large prime generation
    When a research institution wants to create a new ECC standard, one of the first steps is to generate a large prime number. For illustrative purposes, 
    we've implemented a prime generator algorithm relying on **Miller-Rabin's** primaility test, [3].
    In order to speed up the algorithm further, we've implemented a parallel version of Miller-Rabin prime generation, and the parallel approach is straightforward -
    each process will generate it's own random number and perform Miller-Rabin test on the given number - the first process that finds a prime reports the result to 
    the parent process, which in turn terminates other child processes, and the whole algorithm terminates.

                ## Dual_EC_DRBG Controversy
                Random numbers generated on a computer are typically **pseudo-random** - generated numbers appear to be random but under the hood
                they are outputs of a deterministic function. For cryptography, it is crucial to ensure that this deterministic process cannot be reversed -
                otherwise the attacker could unroll the generation process, and predict all future "random" outputs. The algorithms that make this reversal process
                infeasible are known as **CSPRNG - Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators**.

                In 2006, NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology released recommended CSPRNG algorithms ([4]). They developed **Dual_EC_DRBG - 
                Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator** algorithm:

                Points $P, Q \in E(\mathbb{F_p})$ are fixed, and $s_i$ represents the current state of the random bit generator. $\varphi(x, y)$ is just 
                x-coordinate projection function, LSB stands for least significant portion of a byte block, and in particular the output of this algorithm is 
                $bitlen - 16$ long. This means that the attacker is only missing 16 bits of information, and with $2^{16}$ operations we can relatively easy obtain 
                $r_i Q$. If $P, Q$ were generated truly randomly, this would not be a problem. However, as pointed out in [5], if $P = eQ$ and $e$ was known to 
                the attacker (NSA was the one who generated points $P, Q$), then we have:
                $$
                e(r_i Q) = r_i (e Q) = r_i P

                Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm in their cryptographic libraries, and this just intensified previous suspicions.
